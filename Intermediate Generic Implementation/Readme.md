This assignment, for me at least, represented a sharp increase in difficulty.

It has been challenging to fully grasp the implementation of a generic class 
because the concept is quite abstract, and I found myself unable to logically
intuit how to properly build the structure.

I dedicated the majority of my time during this assignment
to figuring out the correct way to build and implement the 
generic class.
This involved watching numerous YouTube videos,
reading official C# documentation, and asking an LLM
to explain the concepts in various ways.

Creating code with generics is incredibly valuable when the goal is to develop
something universal that can be reused in many different situations, regardless of the data type.

For instance, when interacting with external services like APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

We can create a generic client class that handles the entire communication 
process (making the HTTP request, managing errors, and reading the
JSON data). By using generics, this single class can be reused
across an entire project or even across multiple different projects.
